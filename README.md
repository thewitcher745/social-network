# Simple full-stack dev exercise!

## Roughly resembles a social network.

Mostly will be used as boiler plate code for my actual projects.

To see how it works, clone the repo, run `npm run dev` after `cd node-api` from root directory to start the local server (Default port is 3000, can change from .env file). Then `cd` into `/front/` and run `npm start` and hopefully it will work! If it doesn't, it will work at some point in the future.
